Sculk Muffler
=============

A sound muffler block for 1.21.1. Currently, only Neoforge is supported but I
plan on including support for Fabric in a later version.

Rather than muffling specific sounds in a client-side list, this mod adds a
block that muffles all sounds in front of it. You can completely mute them, or
set a volume to make them quieter. The range is adjustable as well.

In addition, this blocks vibrations so sculk sensors and wardens won't be
attracted to muffled sounds. Likewise, the bell's mechanics will be disrupted
when within a zone of silence.

Finally, the Sculk Muffler can be turned off via redstone.
